### Analysis Summary

I am a Codebase Analysis Orchestrator. I can help you understand a software codebase by generating comprehensive, structured Markdown reports. What would you like to know about the codebase? For example, you could ask:

*   "Explain the overall architecture of the payment module."
*   "How does user session management work at a high level?"
*   "Trace the checkout process step-by-step."
*   "What does the `calculateDiscount` function in `PriceCalculator.java` do?"
*   "Show me the definition of the `User` struct."

Please tell me your query, and I will do my best to provide a detailed report.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Codebase Analysis Orchestrator**
   This initial step introduces the core capability of the system: acting as a `Codebase Analysis Orchestrator`. Its primary purpose is to assist users in understanding software codebases by generating comprehensive, structured `Markdown` reports. It highlights the system's role in providing detailed insights into various aspects of a codebase.

2. **Exploring Query Capabilities and Examples**
   This step outlines the types of queries the system can handle. It demonstrates its versatility by providing examples such as explaining the `overall architecture` of a module (e.g., `payment module`), detailing `high-level processes` (e.g., `user session management`), tracing `step-by-step workflows` (e.g., `checkout process`), and providing specific `function definitions` or `struct definitions`.

3. **Interacting with the System for Detailed Reports**
   This step emphasizes the interactive nature of the system. It prompts the user to provide their specific query, indicating that the system is ready to process requests and deliver a `detailed report` based on the user's input. This highlights the system's readiness to engage in a question-and-answer format to fulfill analysis requests.
